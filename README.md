# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is a living study guide for all that I will learn in my bootcamp course. It will serve as both a reference tool and constant project. My hope is that this page becomes a reservoir of foundational development knowledge. Hopefully, the contents of it will one day be ingrained in my mind to the point where this page is no longer necessary. While building it, I have learned a number of basic foundational items related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The webpage is divided into the different topics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each topic has related knowledge listed below it to study or reference. If you open the developer console, you will be able to see functioning JavaScript. One feature of that JavaScript is it will pick a random topic for you to review/study.
